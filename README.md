how to host for rookies! 

HOSTING YOUR BOT ON REPLIT
1. sign up

2. upload your code, to do that create a project first and then you'll see an editor you can either just directly type it in replit or upload it.
   make sure you include your "bot.py" file, this can be named any file but i like to do bot to organize it :3 also put any other files in there.
   
3. install dependecies, replit will automatically recognize a requirments.txt file and install any necessary  libraries, if you dont upload one 
   atleast make sure you have discord.py manually installed.
   
4. run your bot, press the green run button and replit will start your bot.

5. it wont be 24/7, you can use services like uptimerobot which i recommend, it pings your replit every 5 mins.


boom ur done :3333
